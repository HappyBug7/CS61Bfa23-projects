**What distinguishes a hallway from a room? How are they similar?**

Answer: A room has space inside, on the contrary, a hallway has less empty space inside, it is usually used to connect two rooms

**Can you think of an analogy between the process of 
drawing a knight world and randomly generating a world 
using rooms and hallways?**

Answer: if we consider the squares generated in knight's world as rooms, then the process of generate knight's world is pretty similar to generating a world with rooms and hallways in between. The only difference is that the distance between two squares are fixed, while the distance between two rooms may vary. Same as generating knight's world, we could firstly randomly create some rooms and then connect them using hallways, therefore, we finished the process of generate a world with rooms and hallways.

**If you were to start working on world generation, what kind of method would you think of writing first? 
Think back to the lab and the process used to eventually 
get to the full knight world.**

Answer: 
- Firstly, write the algorithm to generate a room at certain point.
- Then, write the algorithm to connect two rooms, use disjoint sets maybe?
- Finally, write the algorithm to pick random point as the start of the process of generating a room.

**This question is open-ended. Write some classes 
and methods that might be useful for Project 3. Think 
about what helper methods and classes you used for the lab!**

Answer: I'll implement them later
